# NotClassic -_- (SOON)


A modified Classicube-based client focused on experimentation, QoL features,
and client-side behavior.

This project exists because curiosity > sanity.

## Features
- Client-side commands
- Teleport utilities
- UI & environment tweaks
- Client-only hacks (no server modification)
- Python-powered chat & block streaming

## Disclaimer
This client is for **educational and experimental purposes ONLY**.  
Some servers may restrict or disallow modified clients.  
Use at your own risk. Don’t be that guy.

## And i wanted to add somethin well...
"STOOOPID" - Root's response, just bored. :p

## Camouflage Client Name to Classicube!

Some servers think as cheat or unsupported client and then boom, one milliseconds kick, so... we got your back to add this option :D
